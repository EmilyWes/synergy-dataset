### Adding SYNERGY datasets
Do you want to help us make SYNERGY even bigger?\
Read on to find how you can do just that!

We are we looking for:\
Systematic reviews, scoping reviews or meta-analysis for which the data is or can be published online.

Let us know where we can find your paper and data using [this](https://forms.gle/Heu8x5jc43Ubja6U6) form!

### But what is "data"?

Below is a snapshot of the type of data we are talking about, it contains:\
	✔️ A list of the papers that were found during the search\
	✔️ Identifiers for the papers like doi, pubmed id and title/year.\
	✔️ A label indicating if the paper was included during the full-text screening\
	❓ Optionally, a label indicating if the paper was included during the title/abstract screening

### What else is required?

✔️ The review or analysis should be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\
✔️ The data should be published on an online data repository like Zenodo or OSF. These are both examples that are free of charge.\
✔️ A permissive license should be added to the data, like CC-By or CC-0

### Some tips / good to know:

- Reference managers like Zotero, EndNote and Mendeley often have nice export functions to create this data
- More data is always welcome, we simply take what we need from it 😃.
- If your data has an url column, it can often contain doi's or pmid's. We will automatically get those out for you! 
- Some examples data repositories to get inspired by:	
	- https://osf.io/e4pn9/
	- https://zenodo.org/records/3625931
 - And don't forget to fill in [this](https://forms.gle/Heu8x5jc43Ubja6U6) form, so that we can pick it up from there!
