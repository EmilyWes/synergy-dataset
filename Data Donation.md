## Adding Synergy datasets

Do you want to help us make SYNERGY even bigger?
Read on to find how you can do just that!

First off all, what are we looking for:
Systematic reviews, scoping reviews or meta-analysis for which the data is or can be published online.

## But what is "data"?
	- Below is a snapshot of the type of data we are talking about, it contains:
		- A list of the papers that were found during the search (each row is 1)
		- Identifiers for the papers like doi, pubmed id and title/year.
		- A label indicating if the paper was included during the full-text screening
		- Optionally, a label indicating if the paper was included during the title/abstract screening
		- This is a csv, but any format can be used, for example .ris and .xlsx are also often chosen.

## What else do we want?
	- The review or analysis should be published in a peer-reviewed journal. 
	- The data should be published on an online data repository like Zenodo or OSF. These are both examples that are free of charge. 
	- A permissive license should be added to the data, like CC-By or CC-0

## Some tips / good to know:
	- Reference managers like Zotero, EndNote and Mendeley often have nice export functions to create this data
	- More data is always welcome, we simply take what we need from it :).
	- If your data has an url column, it can often contain doi's or pmid's. We will automatically get those out for you!
