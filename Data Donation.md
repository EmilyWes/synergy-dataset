### Adding datasets to SYNERGY Plus
Do you want to help us make SYNERGY even bigger?\
Read on to find out how you can do just that!

We are looking for:\
Systematic reviews, scoping reviews, or meta-analyses for which the data is or can be published online.

Let us know where we can find your paper and data using [this](https://forms.gle/Heu8x5jc43Ubja6U6) form!

### But what is "data"?

With data, we refer to the meta-data of the papers that have been screened during the labeling process, and it contains:\
	✔️ A list of the papers that were found during the search.\
	✔️ Identifiers for the papers like DOI or PubMed id's.\
	✔️ A label indicating if the paper was included during the full-text screening.\
	❓ Optionally, a label indicating if the paper was included during the title/abstract screening.

### What else is required?

✔️ The review or meta-analysis should be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\
✔️ The meta-data should be published on a persistent data repository, like Zenodo or OSF.\
✔️ A permissive license should be added to the data, like CC-By or CC-0.

### Some tips / good to know:

- Reference managers like Zotero, EndNote, and Mendeley often have nice export functions to create files that can be put in a data repository.
- If your data has an url column, it can often contain doi's or pmid's. We will automatically get those out for you! 
- Some example data repositories to get inspired by:

	- https://zenodo.org/records/3625931
