Inherent to the nature of population-based studies this meant that except for a selection criterion of age, no other selection criteria were applied; (2) cerebral imaging had to be performed (either magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography) for the visualization of white matter hyperintensities, covert brain infarcts, or microbleeds; (3) all studies had to have investigated the association of any of the three pathologies with the risk of incident all-dementia or AD. We specifically note that we chose all-dementia as primary outcome measure, given that the syndrome diagnosis of dementia can be defined with high consistency across studies and is less dependent on advanced diagnostic testing, which is often not feasible in large population-based studies. Still, we acknowledge the importance of various neuropathologies underlying the clinical manifestation of dementia. To provide additional insight into the association of cerebral small vessel disease with dementia independent of manifest cerebrovascular disease, we also highlighted the associations with a diagnosis of AD (if available in the study) as a secondary outcome measure. We restricted our inclusion to original articles that were written in English and excluded review articles, case reports, conference papers, and editorials."

We chose only to select studies published after 2010 to ensure inclusion of recent and up-to-date scientific nursing outcomes. According to the guidance of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care group, studies were included if the data could be compared with a control or baseline measure, such as randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies or interrupted time series methods. In addition, the studies had to include interventions of a Western origin, be focused on pain care performed by a nurse and include adult patients >18 years. Finally, studies had to be conducted in a hospital or community care setting or contain an intervention transferable to these settings and executed in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development country. Studies involving women in labour or breastfeeding and/or Chinese, alternative or non-Western interventions were excluded."

  eligibility_criteria = "Studies were included if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria for one or more of four outcome measures. The first outcome measure was any alteration in oncologic treatment plan after the geriatric assessment. For this outcome measure, studies were included if a treatment plan was determined both prior to and after the geriatric assessment or if a comparison was made between treatment choice in patient cohorts with and without a geriatric assessment. The second outcome measure was the number and type of recommendations for non-oncologic interventions directly resulting from the findings of the geriatric assessment. The third outcome measure was the effect of the geriatric assessment on patient-doctor communication, for example differences in the content of doctor-patient conversations, care planning, or patient satisfaction with the communication process. The final outcome measure was the effect of the geriatric assessment on outcome of treatment, i.e., toxicity or treatment-related complications, treatment completion, quality of life or physical functioning, mortality, and health care utilisation (such as hospitalisation, length of stay). For both effect on communication and on outcome of treatment, studies were only included if they had a control group which did not undergo a geriatric assessment, and/or if the study had a control group that did not receive geriatric interventions or follow-up whilst the intervention group did. The control groups had to be either based on randomisation or historic/matched cohorts. Studies using a control group that was likely to be subject to confounding or selection bias were excluded (for example, if only vulnerable patients were referred for a geriatric assessment and the control group consisted of non-vulnerable patients). These studies could still be included for other outcome measures."

  eligibility_criteria = "Criteria for inclusion, defined according to PECOS (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome, Setting and Study design)14, including outcomes of interest are detailed in Table 1. Criteria were deliberately broad in terms of setting, frailty definition, and outcomes. Briefly, studies must include adults (≥18 years) with rheumatoid arthritis and assess frailty, although we expect studies may mainly involve ‘older’ populations. Studies were considered regardless of frailty measure, to allow comparison between different methods of identifying frailty. These could include validated measures of frailty (e.g. frailty phenotype or frailty index), adaptations of these measures where the adaptation was described, or unvalidated measures intended to capture frailty as long as the criteria used to define frailty within the study were fully described. We did not exclude studies on the basis of the criteria used to define rheumatoid arthritis (i.e. validated criteria, physician diagnosis, medical record/clinical codes or self-reported definitions were all eligible for inclusion). We included studies in any setting (community, outpatient, or inpatient). Observational studies with cross-sectional or cohort designs were eligible for inclusion. Experimental studies were excluded. When examining the association between frailty and clinical outcomes in those with rheumatoid arthritis, studies were expected to report the association between frailty and the outcome of interest. As in previous reviews of frailty15,16, considered studies that describe this either as the association with the presence or absence of frailty or the association between the degree of frailty and the outcome."

Further, only extended SRL training programs (conducted in real classrooms) were included to distinguish between training programs and one-time experiments.
Moreover, training programs had to target university students (on campus or distance education). Training studies that tested school children, workers, trainees, or students suffering from learning disabilities were excluded.

Moreover, samples had to include at least ten participants per group to assure that effect sizes were approximately normally distributed (Hedges & Olkin, 1985).
